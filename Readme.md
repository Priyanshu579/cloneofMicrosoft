# 🖥️ Microsoft Homepage Clone

A fully responsive clone of the official Microsoft homepage built using **HTML** and **CSS**.  
This project was originally created 2 years ago when I had just learned CSS. Recently, I revisited and upgraded it with a modern, fully responsive layout to improve usability on all screen sizes.
